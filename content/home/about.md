# Bio
Welcome to my personal site! :D 

I am currently a Research Scientist at the Trinidad and Tobago Network Information Centre under the tutelage of Prof. Patrick Hosein, a tutor and marker of the Department of Computing and Information Technology at 
The University of the West Indies, St. Augustine, and a soon to be MPhil student. Previously, I interned at the NASA Ames Research Center under the supervision and mentorship of Mr. Patrick Hogan. Before that, 
I worked as a Research Assistant of the Department of Computing and Information Technology at 
The University of the West Indies, St. Augustine's AgriNeTT project under the supervision of Mr. Kyle DeFreitas.

If you are interested in collaborating on a research project, commissioning me to develop software, or hire me to consult on a project feel free to drop me a line at the email below :).
