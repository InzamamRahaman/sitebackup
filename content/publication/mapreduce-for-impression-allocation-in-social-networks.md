title = "Using MapReduce for Impression Allocation in Online Social Networks"
abstract = "Online Social Networks (OSNs) offer an efficient and cost effective platform for the dissemination of advertisements to potential consumers. User actions and relationshipscan be analyzed to make informed decisions aboutwhere, how, and to whom advertisement impressions should be allocatedto maximize the efficacy of an advertising campaign in an OSN. Based on the observation that users influence their friends, research has been done to decide to whom impressions should be given so as to maximize thetotal number of clicks achieved. Recently, a multistage formulation that involves the allocation of advertisements in stages, has been proposed as a stochastic dynamicprogramming problem. We have developed heuristics based on this formulation and believethat the MapReduce model can be used to further increase performance and reduce compute time.This involves using cluster analysis together with a distributed version of our proposed greedy algorithm. In this paper we provide the framework for this distributed algorithm."
