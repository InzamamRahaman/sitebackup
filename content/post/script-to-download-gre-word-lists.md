One of my favourite resources when I was preparing for the GRE general exam, was the list of word lists provided by Majortests. Major tests provides a total of 15 lists on their site. Instead of downloading them manually, I simply wrote a simple Python script that downloaded them for me.

NB: In addition to the word lists that would be pulled from the above script, I also recommend the flash card application provided by Magoosh GRE prep. Aside from being useful, if you are a logophile like me, you would find it and their VocabularyBuilder app to be loads of fun.
